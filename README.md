## Whats this
Frontend app to test out Svelte, in this case I made this for David / Hollywoodgames (kevin @ tvbet.tv) to function eventually is an UI for live automated sicbo games with sicbo machine.

Unfortenantly machine broke after 1 day xD so never was able to actually make the complete app around automated live games.

## Check page for more releases
Unfortenantly due to pissing off [Softswiss.com](https://softswiss.com) this project never seen daylight, however the idea I've noted down below and maybe someone else can pick this up.

You can find more shit on respins.io or just simply by search 'softswiss' on github as usually I put this within a readme or whatever, so you can find other snippets all regarding casino shit.

F.e. mondogaming.eu etc. all those can be found.

Hopefully at some point @Ivan-Montik will man up and let me work for them while also stop hacking & bugging my pc's, but this is unlikely so feel free to use for whatever reason.
